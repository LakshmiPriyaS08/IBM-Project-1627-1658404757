# Exploratory Analysis of RainFall Data in India for Agriculture

Weather conditions changes then and often. This can lead to Severe threats to all the living beings including human beings.
So predicting weather, especially Irregular heavy rainfall can cause huge floods and economic losses. 
This also decreases crop productivity and may lead into Food shortage. Collection of previous 10 years data may give us an idea about the pattern of Rainfall. 
Using all these Datas, Appropriate farming activities can be performed. These datas can help us in predicting Rainfall .We will using lot of algorithms like KNN, XGboost, etc.
We will train and test the data using these algorithms and predict the best one.
